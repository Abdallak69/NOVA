# Quantum Hardware Interface

This document describes the standardized quantum hardware interface implemented for the QNN project, along with future improvements and extensions.

## Overview

The Quantum Hardware Interface provides a unified API for connecting to various quantum computing platforms, including simulators and real quantum hardware. This abstraction layer allows the QNN code to remain platform-agnostic while still leveraging the unique capabilities of each quantum provider.

## Current Implementation

The current implementation includes:

1. **Abstract Interface** - A base `QuantumHardwareInterface` class that defines the standard methods that all providers must implement
2. **Concrete Implementations**:
   - `CirqHardwareInterface` - For Google Cirq simulators and hardware
   - `QiskitHardwareInterface` - For IBM Qiskit simulators and hardware
3. **Core Functionality**:
   - Circuit execution
   - Device property querying
   - Circuit transpilation with optimization levels
   - Basic circuit format conversion
   - Noise model support for simulators
4. **Manager System** - A `HardwareInterfaceManager` that handles registration and access to various hardware interfaces

## Usage Examples

### Basic Execution

```python
from quantum_hardware_interface import hardware_manager

# Get the default interface
interface = hardware_manager.get_interface()

# Create a circuit using Cirq
import cirq
qubits = cirq.LineQubit.range(2)
circuit = cirq.Circuit(
    cirq.H(qubits[0]),
    cirq.CNOT(qubits[0], qubits[1]),
    cirq.measure(*qubits, key='result')
)

# Execute the circuit
results = interface.execute_circuit(circuit, shots=1000)

# Access the results
print(results['counts'])
```

### Working with Multiple Providers

```python
from quantum_hardware_interface import hardware_manager

# List available interfaces
interfaces = hardware_manager.list_interfaces()
print(interfaces)  # ['Cirq Simulator', 'Qiskit QASM Simulator', ...]

# Get a specific interface
qiskit_interface = hardware_manager.get_interface("Qiskit QASM Simulator")

# Create a Qiskit circuit
import qiskit
qc = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

# Execute on Qiskit
results = qiskit_interface.execute_circuit(qc, shots=1000)
```
