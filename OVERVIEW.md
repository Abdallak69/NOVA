## Usage Examples

Basic usage:
```python
# Create and train a QNN for H2
qnn = MolecularQNN(molecule="H2", bond_length=0.74, depth=2, 
                  ansatz_type="hardware_efficient")

# Train the model
results = qnn.train(iterations=50, verbose=True)

# View results
print(f"Energy: {results['energy']:.6f} Hartree")
qnn.plot_energy_convergence()
```

Hardware execution:
```python
# Set up hardware backend
qnn.set_hardware_backend("ibm_simulator", error_mitigation="readout")
qnn.set_shots(1000)  # Number of measurements per circuit

# Train on hardware
results = qnn.train(iterations=30)
```

Comparing different approaches:
```python
# Compare different ansatz types
comparison_results, fig = qnn.compare_ansatz_types(
    iterations=30,
    methods=['hardware_efficient', 'ucc', 'hva']
)
